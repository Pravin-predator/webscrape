Without question, our beautiful, brilliant,\u00a0dynamic and spirited mother, Ren\u00e9e Unger,\u00a0leaves behind many a legacy; her most\u00a0significant being the greatest mother and\u00a0grandmother and creating the infamous\u00a0Ren\u00e9e's Gourmet Salad Dressings. Born December 11, 1942, Ren\u00e9e was the youngest\u00a0child of Faye (Shankman) (deceased) and Albert\u00a0Mendelson (deceased). Worlds Best Mother to Alysse\u00a0(Andrew Luepann), Lori (Alan Gutmann) and Karen\u00a0(Paul Burstein) and \"Best Bubs\" to Ethan,\u00a0Kaitlyn, Cole and Jamey Luepann, Noah, Layla\u00a0and Zach Gutmann, and Jax, Jazzy, LJ and Emme\u00a0Burstein.

After majoring in mathematics at the University\u00a0of Toronto, Mom went on to receive her teaching\u00a0degree. Already a fabulous cook, she used her\u00a0extraordinary culinary skills to make all-natural salad dressings for family and\u00a0friends in our home kitchen. In 1985, together\u00a0with our dad, they created Ren\u00e9e's Gourmet\u00a0Salad Dressings, which quickly became a family\u00a0favourite in homes across Canada. Though she was a celebrity in the culinary\u00a0world, she never forgot her roots. Always\u00a0thinking of others, our mom was a \"humble and\u00a0quiet\" philanthropist. She taught us to always\u00a0have empathy in others and to give with our\u00a0hearts. All eleven of her grandchildren will forever\u00a0remember her as the cutest, coziest and coolest\u00a0Bubbie ever. She had a special place for each\u00a0and every one of them, often talking stocks,\u00a0cooking, fashion, books, Broadway, movies,\u00a0music and sports. Our mother's passion for\u00a0sports, especially for the Toronto Blue Jay's,\u00a0tennis, football, basketball and hockey was\u00a0passed on to each and every one of our kids. Without a doubt our mom left an impression on\u00a0everyone with whom she ever came in contact.\u00a0She will forever have a prominent place in our\u00a0hearts and minds. She will continue to be an\u00a0inspiration to us all. We love you Mommy with all our hearts. Our\u00a0hearts are broken, but your love and legacy\u00a0will live on - to infinity and beyond.

With a special interest in Emergency Room medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics and Family Practice, he worked as an ER Physician in Trinidad & Tobago for one year then returned to Canada where he joined the Emergency and Family Medicine staff at Queensway General Hospital. There he practiced and held the position of Chief of Family Medicine (1974-1984), President of Medical Staff in 1986, and member of the Board of Governors. While practicing ER medicine, he also maintained a Family Medicine practice on Brown's Line, Toronto until 2012 when he retired on account of his cancer. Ben loved practicing medicine and cherished all his patients, colleagues, fellow staff and peers as they brought much happiness to his life. Unfortunately, Ben's personal life was not as successful as his professional life and in this obituary, he wanted to extend his sincere apology to his late wife and son, and surviving children, grandchildren and siblings for all the neglect and hurt they suffered on account of his actions and choices. In Ben's later years he resided at Viva Retirement Community in Mississauga. He truly enjoyed his time there and appreciated the company and friendship of his fellow community members. Ben also very much appreciated the wonderful care he received from the great staff and management. Ben was thankful for the blessing of all of his doctors and dentists and their staff, nurses and all at the Queensway Site Oncology clinic for the amazing care and treatment he received. The family would like to thank the First Responders, ER doctors, nurses and staff and Credit Valley Hospital for the compassionate care Ben received in his final moments of life, Dr. Winston Makhan for his helpful palliative care advice, Meadowvale Funeral Home/Cemetery and Graeme at Cremation Care Centre on Mimico Avenue for exceptional service provided during a very difficult time. Ben was privately cremated earlier this week. A Mass/service will be held in his honour on Monday, August 23rd at 11:00 a.m., at St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church, 2340 Hurontario St., Mississauga, ON L5B 1N1, (905-272-1454), ", "published_source": "Published in Toronto Star on Jul. 24, 2021."},

Died July 21, 2021 at Toronto Western Hospital after a brief stay at care home Kensington Gardens, at the age of 94 and 1/2. \"Old Aunt Joyce\", as she referred to herself to myself and my husband Robert, her nephew, her only remaining family, simply wore out. She survived the worst of this pandemic-of-a-century, in one of the most fragile of old bodies to succumb to the more familiar complications of old age. Joyce was raised in a Toronto semi-detached home along with her 2 brothers, Gordon and David, off the Danforth by her parents William and Ethel. As a young woman, her aspiration was to travel, which she did, although not extensively due to the constraints of her finances. Her party-girl drink was a Rum and Coke. She dated a number of young men, \"Kenny\", the \"Momma's boy\", whose father told him to marry Joyce because he wanted a grandson. Joyce retorted, \"That's no reason to get married\", so it ended. The big heartbreak was \"Ray\", a Brit, a relationship of \"3 years and 9 months.\" They would go to the Royal York Hotel, dance the Jitterbug with everyone clapping. He left, without telling her, to return to the UK after having an accident, losing his job, and losing his brother. It took her 2 years to get over him. She worked her entire career, at least 45 years, at Gravure-craft, a business generations-old producing the printer materials used at funeral homes (obviously a business with staying power). In retirement, she thoroughly enjoyed the annual Old Mill Christmas dinners hosted by the business, right up until the pandemic put a stop to indoor dining. Joyce lived on her own, having never married or having children, for 48 years in a modest apartment on Jane Street, right at the bus stop near Baby Point. This convenience afforded her the opportunity to easily use the TTC to travel all over the city, which she did regularly with enthusiasm, to shop for her family and friends, a beloved activity. Joyce would go from one end of the city to the other, by train, streetcar, LRT, and bus, navigating it all with her walker up until 8 months ago, when frailty took over. She would curse the unexpected closures of TTC elevators, leaving her stranded at one stop or another, relying on the kindness of Torontonians to assist her in getting up or down the stairs. A cherished activity for Joyce was seeing and enjoying her friends, sharing meals and the stores of all the goings-on in all their lives. She loved classical music, her Herb Alpert LP, the colour blue, kitty cats, travel magazines, crossword puzzles and dining out with her friends. She shunned television after it went digital and her existing TV wouldn't work, refusing a modern one. She never really liked TV anyway. Joyce was inspired by the popular Hallmark card company, 'Keep your heart brave and your imagination wild.' 'The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.' As per Joyce's wishes, there will be no service. A donation to the Scott Mission would be her wish.", "published_source": "Published in Toronto Star on Jul. 24, 2021."},

It was here he met Gabrielle Healy from Cork City, Ireland, whom he married and spent many happy years enjoying the cottage at Curtis Point, Rice Lake. From the day he arrived in Toronto, Mike was a diehard Montreal Canadiens fan and took great pleasure watching them beat the Toronto Maple Leafs.

Born in Sarnia, daughter to Rosella Spero and Stephen Spero (deceased), she is survived by her children Heather, Lucas and Jackson Wiley. She will be missed by her sisters Laura Spero, Katherine Spero, Lynda Kiriakakos (husband Peter) and her twin sister Heather Angelo (husband Dustin). From the day her three beautiful babies were born, Moe was first and foremost a mother. She was a natural mom with her gentle spirit and calming demeanour. As the kids grew up, Moe participated in all their activities. She volunteered and coached both Luke and Jackson's basketball, flag football and soccer teams for a number of years (she notoriously had to YouTube soccer drills as she had NO idea what she was doing). She led Heather's Girl Scout troop and helped coach her elementary school's cross-country team. She never missed a hockey game of the boys or any regatta of Luke's no matter what city it was in. As the kids grew up, Moe was focused on being close to them at all times. Heather and Luke lived out of town and she would drop everything when they returned home for a weekend. She never missed the opportunity to cook and sit down to dinner with Jackson during his busy last year of high school. Her unconditional love shone bright and they in turn are three of the most loving and selfless young adults. Being a mom was pure joy to her. It was never a duty to Maureen, it was pure bliss and she had so much fun being a part of their lives in every aspect. A natural in sports, Moe did everything with passion and her characteristic enthusiasm and joy. She was a Provincial Champion in gymnastics, a Western University Varsity Basketball player and a two-time Ironwoman. She loved her time on the tennis courts and had just decided to get out on the golf course. But above all, she was the (self-proclaimed) family ping pong champ and would play for hours with her kids. With her compassion and gentle nature, Moe was an exceptional teacher and personal trainer. She just recently finished her diploma for Addictions Counseling and was intent on focusing her efforts on kids in distress and helping them with coping skills. Moe was charming, magnetic and could light up a room with her infectious smile and sense of humour. She was always up for some adventure/fun and was innately silly. She loved her music and would often start dancing wherever and whenever and within moments, her kids would fall into sync. Heather, Luke and Jackson were all too familiar with their Mom's (robotic) moves and spontaneity. Wherever she went, her positive spirit and energy drew people to her, while her thoughtfulness and caring nature kept her in their hearts forever. She had the quickest wit on earth and truly loved everyone in her life. Moe was a loyal friend who loved unconditionally. She was so beautiful inside and out. Maureen had the Grace of an Angel and will remain with us forever in spirit. She is peacefully reunited with her father, Stephen Spero, her friend Janet, and her beloved pooches, Bella, Gracie, and Molly. A private funeral service took place on Friday, July 23rd. The family will be hosting a Celebration of Life at a future date. In lieu of flowers, and on behalf of Heather, Luke and Jackson, donations to the Legacy of Hope Foundation (LHR), a national Indigenous charitable organization would be appreciated.

Gord is survived by his wife and best friend of 70-plus years, Estelle; daughter, Lori and husband Terry; son Paul and wife Cathy; and daughter Joanne and husband Bud. He was also a devoted grandpa to grandsons, Andrew (Carly), Tyler (Stacey), and Landon (Paige) and granddaughters Dalyce (Bruno), Daena and Alyson (Michael). Also missing him will be great-grandchildren, Cole, Lucas and Ashlyn. Gord was an electrician and worked for many years at Comstock Electric. He then moved into Purchasing at Bulldog Electric. Later, he moved on to Garland Commercial Ranges where he was in Sales. It was at Garland that he became part of a team that designed a vent for commercial use that soon became patented. There were not many restaurants the family could enjoy without Gord asking to see the kitchen and educate them on the venting system he was so proud of. After retirement from Garland Ventmaster, Gord and Estelle sold their family home and moved to Alliston, where they lived together for another 30 years before Gord's passing. They enjoyed the company of new friends at Greenbriar and also spent many days of leisure at their cottage at Steenburg Lake, where family would continue to visit. In his last years, Gord was part of the Kingsmere Retirement community. He was well-loved and his spirit will live on in generations to follow. There will be a private service and a Celebration of Life will be held at a later date. \"The Lord turn His face toward you and give you Peace\" www.thomasfuneralhome.ca", "published_source": "Published in Toronto Star on Jul. 25, 2021."},
